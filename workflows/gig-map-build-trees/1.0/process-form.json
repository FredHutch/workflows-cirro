                "description": "RAxML-NG is a phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality criterion. Its search heuristic is based on iteratively performing a series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves, which allows to quickly navigate to the best-known ML tree. RAxML-NG is a successor of RAxML (Stamatakis 2014) and leverages the highly optimized likelihood computation implemented in libpll (Flouri et al. 2014).",
